# Generator Functions

## What are `Generator Functions`?

_ChatGPT:_
Generator functions in JavaScript are special functions that can be paused during execution and later resumed, allowing the function to produce a series of values over time. They are defined using the `function*` syntax, and use the `yield` keyword to produce values one at a time. Generators are useful for implementing complex and asynchronous logic, as well as for working with infinite data streams.
